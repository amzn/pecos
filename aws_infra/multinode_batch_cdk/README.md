# PECOS Distributed Training Infra AWS Multi-node Batch CDK

This sub-folder contains AWS Multi-node Batch CDK code for fast generation of the infra for training distributed PECOS models.

## Prerequisite

1. AWS account with access to VPC, Batch, EC2, S3, ECR.
2. Setup AWS credentials following [[guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-credentials.html)].
3. Install `npm` and `node` if you haven't:
    * Download nvm script:
        ```
        curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
        ```
    * Append below to shell config (e.g. `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`), and source it:
        ```
        # Append below
        export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
        [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
        [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion

        # Source shell config
        source <YOUR_SHELL_CONFIG>
        ```
    * Install latest CDK-supported `Node.js` and `npm`:
        ```
        # NOTE: latest node version is not always supported by CDK, double-check before installation
        nvm install 14.6.0
        ```
    * Check installation:
        ```
        node -v
        npm -v
        ```
4. Install AWS CDK:
    ```
    npm install -g aws-cdk@2.40.0

    # Check installation
    cdk --version
    ```

## Usage
Clone code:
```
git clone https://github.com/amzn/pecos.git
cd pecos/aws_infra/multinode_batch_cdk
```

Create Python virtual environment and install dependencies:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Configure parameters. Make sure *AWS account* and *AWS region* are the *same* as environmentâ€™s *AWS credential*.

```
./config_generator.py
```
This will generate a `param_config.json` file in the same directory as `config_generator.py`, which will be used for the CDK synth.

Bootstrap:
```
# Replace contents in <> with your AWS account number and region
cdk bootstrap aws://<YOUR_AWS_ID>/<YOUR_REGION>
```

CDK synthesize and display change:
```
cdk synth
cdk diff
```

CDK deploy all stacks:
* An image for running distributed PECOS containers will also be built and uploaded, so it may take a while.
```
cdk deploy --all
```
You could open AWS CloudFormation web console [[link](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)] to check the deployed resources.

If you do not need the infra anymore, delete the ECR repository and S3 bucket generated by CDK first, then destroy:
```
cdk destroy --all
```

## Example

Download `eurlex-4k` data and upload to the S3 bucket created by CDK:
```
wget https://archive.org/download/pecos-dataset/xmc-base/eurlex-4k.tar.gz
tar -zxvf eurlex-4k.tar.gz
aws s3 cp --recursive ./xmc-base/eurlex-4k \
s3://pecos-distributed-bucket-<YOUR_AWS_ID>-<YOUR_NAME>/input-eurlex-4k/
```

Submit job by executing the following commands in the `aws_infra/multinode_batch_cdk` directory:
```
./submit_job.py \
--job-name pecos-train-xlinear-eurlex-4k \
--input-folder input-eurlex-4k \
--output-folder output-eurlex-4k \
--num-nodes 2 \
--cpu 1 \
--memory 60000 \
--commands 'mpiexec -n $AWS_BATCH_JOB_NUM_NODES -f /job/hostfile python3 -m pecos.distributed.xmc.xlinear.train \
-x $PECOS_INPUT/tfidf-attnxml/X.trn.npz \
-y $PECOS_INPUT/Y.trn.npz \
-m $PECOS_OUTPUT/eurlex_model \
--nr-splits 2 -b 50 -k 100 -nst 16 -t 0.1
python3 -m pecos.xmc.xlinear.predict \
-x $PECOS_INPUT/tfidf-attnxml/X.tst.npz \
-y $PECOS_INPUT/Y.tst.npz \
-m $PECOS_OUTPUT/eurlex_model > $PECOS_OUTPUT/eurlex_score.txt'
```
in which `$PECOS_INPUT` contains everything downloaded from the S3 input folder given by your parameters, and you should put all outputs into `$PECOS_OUTPUT` for uploading to S3 bucket.
For full parameter list, please check `submit_job.py`

After submitting the job, navigate to AWS Batch web console [[link](https://console.aws.amazon.com/batch/)] to check job running status.

After job done, check output model `eurlex_model/` and score `eurlex_score.txt` in the folder `output-eurlex-4k` of S3 bucket generated by CDK.
