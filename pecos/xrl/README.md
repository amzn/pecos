XRL(Working in progress)

XRL contains a set of algorithms aiming to solve extremely large reinforcement learning
problems. The problems addressed include Markov decision problems both in the model-based and
model-free settings. The algorithms are compactly grouped in a python class which has various
functions including training functions, plotting functions and some auxiliary functions. The
implementation includes policy gradient methods as well as gradient-based methods for the
primal-dual formulation. Some functionalities are still under testing.
